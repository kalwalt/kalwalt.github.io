	<p>I create abstract sculptures with different materials: Marble, stone, wood, bronze, acrylic and epoxy resyns.

	<p> </p>
	<p>The majority of interactive artworks consist of acrylic paintings with markers for augmented reality.
		My research consists in finding an agreement between the abstract forms of the markers and
		the abstract organic forms of my paintings. Above the markers you can see text appearing,
		particle animations, 3d objects or videos. </p>
	<p>For a complete description of my interactive artworks i suggest to you to go to my website
