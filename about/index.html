	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm a visual artist, my media fields are: sculpture, painting, drawing, 3d, coding and interactivity</p>
	<p>Kalwalt is my nickname at github repository and other places. I used this nick because is a combination of my real name and
		an old nickname when i was a young climber...But this is a very long story that i will not tell now. It would take a lot of time ..
		Apart of my passion for interactivty and programming, i am a Nature lover. I like to make long walking in the forest or
		in beautiful mountain landscapes, and to try, when possible, to go for a trek.
		What else? i like a big cup of coffe and a slice of cake...and a good book!
