	<p>I am Kalwalt alias Walter Perdan, i am an italian visual artist. My artistic
		 research has a wide range, from painting, sculpture, drawing and interactive art.
		 I like to mix different languages and search connections between innovative media
		 and traditional one. I love abstract and surreal art and some aspect of psicadelyc art.
		  I believe in experimentation and this is a daily practice.
			In this website you can find all my applications
		 used for my interactive artworks <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
