I like the abstract art and the surreal art, my paintings reflect this my enjoyment.
I usually paint with acrylic colors, watercolors and other techniques. I create forms that represent state of mind rather imitate Nature. In my paintings, i try to find a balance between expression and abstraction, innovation and tradition.

I create abstract sculptures with different materials: Marble, stone, wood, bronze, acrylic and epoxy resyns.
I like to feel the material under my fingers and express my emotions of Form and of Nature. A part of my research wants to represent the concepts of time and space and the change of our being in a "liquid" society: The reflection of our way of living and thinking in the contemporary world.

The majority of interactive artworks consist of acrylic paintings with markers for augmented reality.
My research consists in finding an agreement between the abstract forms of the markers and
the abstract organic forms of my paintings. Above the markers you can see text appearing, particle animations, 3d objects or videos. My effort is to continuously find new ways to make art and move the limit of language ...

For a complete description of my interactive artworks i suggest to you to go to my website in my [augmented reality section.](https://www.walterperdan.com/en/artworks/new-media/augmented-reality)
