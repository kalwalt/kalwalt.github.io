Kalwalt is my nickname at github repository and other places. I used this nick because is a combination of my real name and
  an old nickname when i was a young climber...But this is a very long story that i will not tell now. It would take a lot of time ...
  Apart of my passion for interactivty and programming, i am a Nature lover. I like to make long walking in the forest or
  in beautiful mountain landscapes, and to try, when possible, to go for a trek.
  What else? i like a big cup of coffe and a slice of cake...and a good book!
  If you want to know really more about me, i invite you to my official page
