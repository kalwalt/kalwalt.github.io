Lately I worked a lot on my [kalwaltart.it](https://www.kalwaltart.it) website, because i would add the responsive feature to all my images in the pages, basically with `srcset`attribute you can switch a corresponding image size for every different screen device. This increase the performances of the site and make a better user experience. I used the [**jekyll-responsive-image** ](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/jekyll-responsive-image)plugin and i am very satisfyied. 

Another important added feature is the **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pp technology within you can install a website on your device (smartphone, tablet or desktop pc...). Not all the work is done but the basic functions are set. The idea behind is that an user can install my website and run all the interactivity apps even without a internet connection, in offline mode.

From an artistic point of view i made some new little acrylic painting and some works on paper with the collage technique. But i make also a liitle wood sculpture, _"Una fessura nel cielo"_ (English: a crack in the sky) is almost finished, i think in these days it will be ready for some official pictures to be posted on my [walterperdan.com](https://www.walterperdan.com) website. More to come, stay tuned!
