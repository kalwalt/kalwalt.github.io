I introduce myself: my name is Walter Perdan and I am an Italian artist who likes to work in different fields. I like interactive art and in particular I have specialized in applications with devices for augmented reality. I'm also a fan of programming, web design and information technology. I trained at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna and I had several experiences: at first I attended the course of painting and in the future I graduated in sculpture. At the same time, I was interested in interactive art applications with augmented reality. My final thesis is indeed made up of an interactive work, it is [Ecotopia of art](https://www.walterperdan.com/en/artworks/new-media/interactivity/ecotopia-art). In my website you can visit also my other interactive works at this page: [interactive artworks](https://www.walterperdan.com/en/artworks/new-media/augmented-reality). 

In this website instead are listed all my interactive software applications, and in this blog i post some articles about interactivity and augmented reality.
