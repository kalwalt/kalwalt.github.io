In this last month i was focused in the development of my two websites and to the development of the javascript library [jsartoolit5](https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5). I will explain better. I am a visual artist but i am interested in developing of application with augmented reality: you can found some informations for the intereactive part of my works in this [website](www.kalawaltart.it) and all my artworks ( not related to interactive art) are presented in my official website [www.walterperdan.com](https://www.walterperdan.com). As i said i worked on adding image responsive feature to my kalwaltart.it website
