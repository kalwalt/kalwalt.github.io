## Improvements: migrating to uploadcare and other news.

In this last month i was focused in the development of my two websites and the javascript library [jsartoolkit5](https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5). I will explain better. I am a visual artist but i am interested in the development of applications with augmented reality: you can found some informations for the interactive part of my works in the kalwaltart.it [website](www.kalawaltart.it) and all my artworks ( not related only to interactive art) are presented in my official website [www.walterperdan.com](https://www.walterperdan.com). As i said i worked on adding image responsive feature to my kalwaltart.it website; at the beginning i implemented the [jekyll-responsive-image](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/jekyll-responsive-image) plugin ( my site is a static site based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), not bad but as i started to add .webp format i had some issue with the server because it hasn't the required imagemagick library supporting the .webp format. And also my github repository was getting bigger and bigger. For this reason i start to migrating to [**uploadcare**](https://uploadcare.com) services: It is a service company that provide a **CDN** where to store your images. You upload your images to the uploadcare server and you past a link in your < img > tag:

```
<img src="https://ucarecdn.com/70146e27-890d-498c-af4f-7000cf842210/">
```

The benefit of this approach is:

* less stress for the hosting server (at least with jekyll and imagemagick)
* the github repository will be lighter, because you will not store anymore any images.

I will use this service also for my other website, but, for this, i slowly migrating to a "Gatsbyjs" system. [**Gatsby.js**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) is an plugin ecosystem based primarly on React. I am learning both, but it seems very promising. The main characteristic of [**React**](https://reactjs.org) is the use of Virtual DOM and the Component architecture. I will inform you of my progress...

In these days i spent also my time to improve the [Jsartoolkit5](https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5) library. I would add the **NFT** ( Natural Feature Tracking ) , that is a markerless approach for the augmented reality applications. To be honest there is already a [NFT branch](https://github.com/artoolkitx/jsartoolkit5/tree/nft) but the problem is the slow performances in fps terms and the fact that it is very old:  it require an update.

For now i solved some problems while compiling the lib; the next step will be to find the bottlenecks of the code ( i think it will be not so easy), I hope to solve this, it will be very interesting developing some apps with a markerless approach.

From this point of view i am working on some collage art with markers and augmented reality thanks to AR.js library. It is the same approach that i used to make ["Art is a joke"](https://www.walterperdan.com/en/artworks/painting/2018-painting/artisajoke-abstract-painting) the acrylic painting showed in this page.

I also start to build some Markerless app and artworks based on the [**ArtoolkitX**](https://github.com/artoolkitx/artoolkitx) library for Android., until NFT will not available in jsartoolkit5 and AR.js.
