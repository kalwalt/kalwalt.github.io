## What is happened? News about my interactive projects.
What is happened with my Artivive projects? As i said in a previuos post i was working for the Kaleida studio open call "Push the boundaries". I submitted my project to the curator but unfortunately even if they liked my project was not accepted for the show. Sad for this but i want in any case to finish it. For this reason i decided that when it will be finished i release a free version for everybody. What does it means in specific? I will left a downloadable picture not at the maximum resolution but that can be printed in a postcard format for a personal use: You can print for you but not sell it. More infos when the work will be ready. Stay tuned!
